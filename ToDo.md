# Slack Todo

- [ ] Set up a development environment with the necessary libraries and tools, such as Python, Slack SDK, Firebase Admin SDK, and apscheduler.

- [ ] Create a new Slack bot and obtain a bot token.

- [ ] Set up a Firebase project and create a new Firebase Realtime Database instance for the Slack bot.

- [ ] Write code to authenticate with the Slack API and obtain a reference to the Firebase Realtime Database.

- [ ] Write code to use the Slack API to send a direct message to the user on Monday asking them to fill out their to-dos for the week.

- [ ] Write code to use a scheduler library (such as apscheduler) to schedule messages to be sent every day from Tuesday to Friday, reminding the user of their to-dos for that day.

- [ ] Write code to create a new Firebase Realtime Database instance for each user, and use the user's Slack ID as the key for their instance.

- [ ] Write code to store the user's to-dos as a list of objects, with each object containing the to-do text and a boolean flag indicating whether it has been completed.

- [ ] Write code to use the Slack API to open a dialog with the user, prompting them to enter their to-dos for the week.

- [ ] Write code to store the user's to-dos in the Firebase Realtime Database when they submit the dialog.

- [ ] Write code to query the Firebase Realtime Database for the user's to-dos for that day and include them in the reminder message.

- [ ] Write code to use the Slack API to create a checkbox UI element for each to-do.

- [ ] Write code to update the Firebase Realtime Database when a user marks a to-do as done through the checkbox UI.

- [ ] Write code to calculate the percentage of completed to-dos at the end of the week and send a report to the user through a direct message.

- [ ] Test the bot thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and handles all possible edge cases.

- [ ] Deploy the bot to a production environment and monitor it to ensure that it continues to function correctly.
